\section{Theoretical Background}

Averaging of images of identical specimens (motive) for the purpose of noise elimination 
has a long history in many research fields. According to theory, averaging
over a correct set of images is equivalent to the result of Fourier filtration
of a regular 2D montage of that set (using appropriate delta-functions as a mask)
to pass only the Fourier components associated with the signal. (Aebi 1973)



\section {Calculation}

A noisy 2D crystals should be quasi optically filtered in order to restore 
a noiseless motive.

The method requires:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Fourier transform the original image
 \item Mask the Fourier transform 
 \item Integrate the density in the masked region
 \item Perform an inverse Fourier transform

\end{itemize}

\section {Objetive}
Using Matlab implemented a quasi optical filtration of a 2D crystal
