\section{Theoretical Background}

Biological crystals are seldom perfect, they present distortions
and stretching, are limited in extent and disordered.
These imperfections degrade the Fourier Transform (FT) and reduce
high resolution information. The degradation of the FT
produces a broadening of the peaks at the reciprocal lattice
(i.e., they are no longer a delta function but a Gaussian)
plus an attenuation of the high frequency terms. As filtering
(in Fourier space) is equivalent to averaging all the unit
cells in the crystal (in real space), this degradation makes
the average unit cell blurred. In other words, crystal imperfections
translate into small misalignments of the different
unit cells and the final average then turns out blurred.
Lattice unbending was developed by Henderson et al.
(1986), to correct these distortions and recover high resolution
information.

\noindent where $F_1$ is Fourier transform for  volume 1, $F_2^{\ast}$ is the complex conjugate of the Fourier transform for volume 2, and $r_i$ is the individual voxel element at radius r. In this form, the FSC takes two three-dimensional data sets and converts them into a one-dimensional array.

\section {Objetive}
Using Matlab implemented the FSC
